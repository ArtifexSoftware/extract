There was one who was famed for the number of things
   He forgot when he entered the ship:
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,
   And the clothes he had bought for the trip.
He had forty-two  boxes, all carefully packed,
   With his name painted clearly on each:
But, since he omitted to mention the fact,
   They were all left behind on the beach.
The crew was complete: it included a Boots—    A maker of Bonnets and Hoods— A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes—    And a Broker, to value their goods.
A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,    Might perhaps have won more than his share— But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,    Had the whole of their cash in his care.
There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,    Or would sit making lace in the bow: And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,    Though none of the sailors knew how.
"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,
   As he landed his crew with care;
Supporting each man on the top of the tide
   By a finger entwined in his hair.
"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:
   That alone should encourage the crew.
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:
   What I tell you three times is true."
young man of Madras,
balls were constructed of brass,
hen jangled together,
They played “Stormy Weather”,
And lightning shot out of his ass.
A Python, I sh
For it needs a docto
And has the Measles yearly
However, if you feel inclined
To get one (to improve your mind,
And not from fashion merely),
Allow no music near its cage;
And when it flies into a rage
Chastise it, most severely.
I had an Aunt in Yucatan
Who bought a Python from a man
And kept it for a pet.
She died, because she never knew
These simple little rules and few; —
The snake is living yet.
