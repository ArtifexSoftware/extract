There was one who was famed for the number of things    He forgot when he entered the ship: His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,    And the clothes he had bought for the trip.
He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,    With his name painted clearly on each: But, since he omitted to mention the fact,    They were all left behind on the beach.
The crew was complete: it included a Boots—    A maker of Bonnets and Hoods— A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes—    And a Broker, to value their goods.
A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,    Might perhaps have won more than his share— But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,    Had the whole of their cash in his care.
There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,    Or would sit making lace in the bow: And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,    Though none of the sailors knew how.
"Just the place for a Snark!" the Bellman cried,    As he landed his crew with care; Supporting each man on the top of the tide    By a finger entwined in his hair.
"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:    That alone should encourage the crew. Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:    What I tell you three times is true."
young man of Madras, balls were constructed of brass, hen jangled together, They played “Stormy Weather”, And lightning shot out of his ass.
A Python, I sh For it needs a docto And has the Measles yearly However, if you feel inclined To get one (to improve your mind, And not from fashion merely), Allow no music near its cage; And when it flies into a rage Chastise it, most severely. I had an Aunt in Yucatan Who bought a Python from a man And kept it for a pet. She died, because she never knew These simple little rules and few; — The snake is living yet.
